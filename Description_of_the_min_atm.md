# Simple-mini_atm

INTRO:

Hi amigos,
  I am yaswanth you can call me yash. This repo contains a simple mini atm program coded by using python and OOPS.
  In mini_atm you can see your accountant balance , deposit money and withdrawl money from our bank accountant
  
HOW IT WORKS:

The program works like a real ATM machine. In this mini_atm:
-> Frst you have to enter the pin
-> If the pin correct the program excute the next process
-> Ese you entered the wrong pin the mini_atm gives user another two tries to enter the coreect password
-> After you entered the correct pin the code prints the three options .Those 
-> First one is showing your account balance second one is deposit and third one is withdrawl
-> After completion of your above three works the mini_atm exit from the code
